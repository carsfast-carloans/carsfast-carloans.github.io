            <p><strong>Consent, Communication, Services Paid &amp; Financial Products and Services&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>You acknowledge and agree that you shall be responsible for each and every access, use or employment of this website
                (and any of its related services) that occurs in conjunction with your passwords and user identifications, and that
